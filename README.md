### ideas

- ffmpeg make gif's of all clips, and offer a gif link/download for each clip :-)
- split into alphabet order, with "a", "b", etc., sections and links at the top
- stop previously playing video when a new video is played (will help performance?)
- use video js for a nice play icon in the middle?
- ffmpeg webm versions for non-H264 browsers?
- a little note at the top as introduction and probably useful for SEO
- play video when hoovering, rather than having to click
